    "Jacob Corn is the Managing Director and Scientific Director of the Innovative Genomics Initiative and faculty at UC Berkeley in the department of Molecular and Cell Biology. For several years he was a group and project team leader at Genentech in the department of Early Discovery Biochemistry, leading multidisciplinary teams to interrogate mechanism and feasibility for challenging therapeutic pathways in the areas of neurobiology, infectious disease, and oncology.  Jacob did his graduate work with James Berger, where his work helped redefine the organization of the bacterial replication fork and he the recipient of the Nicholas Cozzarelli and Harold M. Weintraub awards. As a Jane Coffin Childs Fellow with David Baker, Jacob computationally designed protein-protein interactions from scratch. While specifically providing insight into the molecular underpinnings of ubiquitin signaling, Jacob’s research generally bridges reductionist mechanism with cell biology, with the overarching goal of understanding how biophysical properties interact within the cellular environment to shape signaling behavior and how disease arises when these properties go awry. As the director of the IGI, Jacob is committed to pushing the boundaries of next-generation genome editing for transformative insights into fundamental biologies and to laying the groundwork for clinical and commercial applications of the technology. Jacob is furthermore dedicated to building new models for collaboration between academic and commercial organizations, mentoring at the interface of the two areas, and actively promoting entrepreneurship in the biological sciences.",
